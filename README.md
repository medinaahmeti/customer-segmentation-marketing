# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques

## Overview
This project applies clustering techniques to the UCI Online Retail dataset to identify meaningful customer segments. The study utilizes K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. Additionally, the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model is used to analyze customer behavior, allowing businesses to improve marketing strategies and customer relationships.

## Key Features
- **Clustering Methods**: Implements K-means and agglomerative clustering.
- **Evaluation Techniques**: Uses the Elbow method, dendrograms, and within-cluster sum of squares to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Customer Segments**: Identifies low-engagement, medium-engagement, and high-engagement customer groups.
- **Business Insights**: Provides recommendations on retaining at-risk customers and rewarding loyal customers.
- **Data-Driven Marketing**: Helps businesses optimize customer engagement and improve marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The project uses the **UCI Online Retail dataset**, which includes transaction data for a UK-based online retail company. The dataset contains details such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r 
   ```

3. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python 
   ```

## Usage
- Run scripts to generate customer segments.
- Use the visualization scripts to analyze results and extract business insights.

## Results
- **K-means Clustering**: Effectively groups customers based on behavior patterns.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Provides deeper insights into relationships between segments.
- **RFM Analysis**: Enhances customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.

## Future Improvements
